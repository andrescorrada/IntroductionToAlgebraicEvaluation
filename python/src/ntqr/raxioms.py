class MAxiomIdeals:
    """
    Class for generating the M=m axioms given labels and classifiers.

    Each subset of the classifiers has a set of axioms, of size R,
    involving the marginalized decisions of that subset. For each
    value of the size of a subset, M, we can establish universal
    relations between counts of observed M-sized decision tuples
    and the counts of those tuples and smaller ones given true labels.

    The bottom of the M axioms ladder is M=1, the individual axioms.
    These carve out the evaluations for a given test taker given their
    marginalized response counts. This is a subset of the R-simplex,
    for an individual test taker, for any test of size Q. Thus, each
    test-taker in a group of N gets their own M=1 set of axioms.

    The M=2 axioms correspond to all possible pairs in a group of N
    test takers. These involve all the variables in the  M=1 axioms
    but now define a new set of axioms involving the pair response
    variables.

    In R-space, the space of integer response counts, all these
    ideals are linear equations. Thus, it may seem that calling them
    'ideals', while strictly true, is overkill. However, in P-space,
    these ideals are polynomials of degree 2 or higher.
