# This is the most important test module for the NTQR package.
# The current tests use experimental data for binary classifiers.
# A better test suite should include at least R=3 tests since that
# is when two classifiers can disagree and both be wrong.

# This test sketch comes from experiments following Bin Yu's Chapter
# 13 Jupyter notebook experiments with the online consumer dataset.
